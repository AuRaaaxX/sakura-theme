# Rubii'z Sakura Theme


Repository for the two versions of my modified theme.
I created the theme with horizontal servers in mind, but it relies on another Dev.
So for the days its down I have created a standard version.

Currently Supported Plugins: 
1) Server Folders by DevilBro: https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/plugins/ServerFolders 
is supported by the horizontal theme creator https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/themes/Horizontal%20Serverlist

2) Badges Everywhere: https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/plugins/Badges%20Everywhere

3) Char Counter by Square: https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/plugins/Character%20Counter

4) Google Translate Option by DevilBro: https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/plugins/Google%20Translate%20Option

5) MemberCount by Arashiryuu: https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/plugins/MemberCount

6) RoleMembers by Zerebos: https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/plugins/RoleMembers

7) User Birthdays by Metalloriff: https://betterdiscordlibrary.com/plugins/User%20Birthdays
requires variable change  --user-popout-top: -35px;  

8) Show Image Details: https://discordplugins.com/plugin/show-image-details
my theme displays image details on hover, to keep the theme simplistic in nature


The testing version is my personal current, due to the nature CSS changes in one area can and does affect other parts of discord so I will have new features and ideas up on this for a week or so before they are pushed to the normal versions.

only available in horizontal servers, errors are relitively common but are fixed quicker; just the usual benifits and disbenifits of being on the bleeding edge


If your not sure how to get the theme: 
1) firstly decide what u want, a horizontal or vertical server list

2) open the corrisponding file that ends in `.theme.css` (this will allow u to drop it into the themes folder)

3) click `Raw`

4) Right Click, select `Save As` 

5) Drop in themes folder



At this point it should be visible by discord and u should only need to activate it.
