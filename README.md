# Rubii'z Sakura Theme


Repository for the two versions of my modified theme.
I created the theme with horizontal servers in mind, but it relies on another Dev.
So for the days its down I have created a standard version.


If your not sure how to get the theme: 
1) firstly decide what u want, a horizontal or vertical server list

2) open the corrisponding file that ends in `.theme.css` (this will allow u to drop it into the themes folder)

3) click `Raw`

4) Right Click, select `Save As` 

5) Drop in themes folder



At this point it should be visible by discord and u should only need to activate it.
